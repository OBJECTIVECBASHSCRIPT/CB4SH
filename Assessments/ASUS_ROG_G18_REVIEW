I've had this machine for less than a year. Within the time that I had it, I've experienced multiple issues. 
For one, the product spontaneously terminates the Asus Precision Trackpad functionality. 
I have troubleshooted the issue and as of yet, the only thing that reactivates it, is a soft reboot.
Additionally, the Windows 11 native OS is buggy. 
This is not a primary concern of mine as I use the machine for my security research work and I use VMware anyway, 
however for those who use the machine to game, this could definitely be problematic.
For clarification purposes, the machine's display screen on Windows 11 taskbar flickers displaying multiple taskbars on the screen.
The machine is also prone to overheating even when in eco mode. 
I've troubleshooted both issues and thus far, the only band-aid fix has been to hard reboot from BIOS. 
Thankfully, none of these issues besides the touchpad dying exist through VM isolation, 
so I assume this is an issue with the method in which the native Windows 11 OS is configured. 
The touchpad issue also can be perma-fixed by using an external mouse with the computer. 
Overall, this is a powerful yet unstable machine.
I purchased the G15 in 2022 and the performance otherwise was great, but the same issues existed. 
It would frequently overheat and blue screen.
I would not recommend the ASUS ROG machines.
