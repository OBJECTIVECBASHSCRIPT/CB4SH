🧾 GothPWN Recon Assessment Report: T-Mobile Gateway (#######)
📍 Target Information

    IP Address: ######

    Network Type: T-Mobile Home Internet (Carrier NAT or LTE Gateway)

    MAC Vendor: VMware (suggests VM network emulation — possibly 5G gateway virtualization)

    Tested From: Local LAN segment (###.###.###.#/24)

🛰️ Scanning Methodology

    Tools Used: nmap, arp-scan, masscan, gobuster, nbtscan

    Scan Types:

        Ping sweep (nmap -sn)

        Full TCP port scan (nmap -sS -sV -p-)

        HTTP enumeration (attempted with gobuster)

        NetBIOS and SMB probing

    Access Level: Scans run from a device on the same subnet

🧪 Findings Summary
Test	Result
Host Discovery	Host responded to ARP & ICMP — confirmed live
TCP Port Scan	No open ports detected across all 65,535 TCP ports
UDP Scan (sampled)	Not performed (optional)
HTTP/Web Interface	No service on port 80/443 or any alternative web UI ports
SMB/NetBIOS	No Windows services exposed
Masscan / Gobuster	Timed out or returned no accessible services
🔐 Security Posture Assessment

✅ POSITIVE FINDINGS:

    No exposed management interface — prevents local attacks such as:

        Default credential abuse

        CSRF against router config

        Web UI XSS

    All services filtered or dropped — likely due to firewall policies

    No DNS/SMB leakage — good for defending against passive recon

⚠️ NOTES:

    Could not determine router firmware, vendor, or service stack (likely intentional)

    Assumes no physical access and no default wireless exposure

📦 Security Rating

Surface Exposure:  🔒 MINIMAL
Attack Surface:    🟢 LOW RISK (from LAN)
Misconfigs Found:  ❌ NONE DETECTED
Overall Status:    ✅ SECURE

🧠 Recommendations

    ✅ No action needed — default gateway is hardened against local recon

    🔍 Optional: Check if web admin panel is only available from WAN or authenticated sessions

    📶 Audit Wi-Fi security: Ensure WPA2 or WPA3 is enabled and default SSID/passwords are changed

    🧬 Periodically scan for firmware updates or CVEs related to your model (use nmap -O to try to ID)
